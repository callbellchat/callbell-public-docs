# Getting started

## What is Zapier?

Zapier is a tool that allows you to connect apps you use every day to automate tasks and save time. You can connect any of our 2,000+ integrated apps together to make your own automations. What's more it's quick and easy to set up - you don't need to be a developer, anyone can make a Zap!

## How does Zapier work?

Zapier uses a **Zap** to connect two or more apps together.

A Zap is made up of a **Trigger** and one or more **Actions** or **Searches**.

Whenever the trigger happens in one app, Zapier will automatically perform the actions or searches in another app in order.

## How to use Callbell with Zapier

### Set up your Zap

There are two ways you can integrate Callbell with other apps: **Trigger** and **Action**.

### Trigger

When a new conversation is created in Callbell, you can send the data to another app. For example, you can send the data to a Google Sheet, a CRM, or a Slack channel.

### Action

When an event happens in another app, you can send the data to Callbell. For example, you can send data from a Google Sheet, a CRM, or a Slack channel to Callbell.

### Example

Let's say you want to send a message to a customer when a new order is made on your online store. You can use Zapier to send the data from your online store to Callbell.

Your online store is the **Trigger** and Callbell is the **Action**.

In the next section, we'll show you how to set up a Zap.
