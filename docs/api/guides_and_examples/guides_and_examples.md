# How-to and Examples

This guide will show you how to use the Callbell API to send messages, get updates, and keep contact info up to date.

## Getting Started with Callbell

If you're new to Callbell, you can start with our [Getting Started with Callbell Guide](/getting_started).
We'll also look at some examples of using the Callbell API.

The examples fall into two categories: **Events Caused by Actions** and **Actions Driven by Events**.

## Events Caused by Actions

Events Caused by Actions are updates that happen because of an action. Like when someone new joins your website, it triggers a new event. You can sign up for these events and get a notice when they happen.

Here you'll find examples of events that the Callbell API can trigger. Use these examples to understand how to use Callbell API to send messages and update contact info when a new event happens.

:::info
For the webhook endpoint, you can use a service like [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) or [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/). These are temporary endpoints for testing your setup. For actual use, you'll need to create your own endpoint. You'll need a webserver to receive the events and send messages to your customers using your own endpoint. You can use any programming language to do this.

### Message Events

You can use the Callbell API to send messages when a new event happens.
We'll use the [Messages API](/api/reference/messages_api/introduction) to send messages. Check out the [Webhooks](/api/reference/webhooks/introduction) section for more info on signing up for events.

First, we need to set up a webhook endpoint to get the events. We'll use [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) to create a temporary endpoint.

1. Go to [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) and click on **Create a RequestBin**.
2. Copy the URL of the new RequestBin you just created.
3. Set up your webhook endpoint on Callbell. See [Webhooks](/api/reference/webhooks/introduction) for more info.

After setting up the webhook endpoint, we can use the Callbell API to send a chatbot message when a new message comes in. Check out the [Messages API](/api/reference/messages_api/introduction) for more info on sending messages.

Here's a diagram of how the Callbell API sends a chatbot message when a new message comes in.
