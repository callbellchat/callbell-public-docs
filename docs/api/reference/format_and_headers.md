All responses are returned in JSON format. On the other hand, the API accepts JSON payloads only, meaning that itâ€™s the client responsibility to send an accept header like the following:

```
Accept: application/json
```

Following the same logic, all body endpoints (e.g. in POST, PUT and PATCH requests) needs to be JSON-encoded accordingly.
