# Introduction

Custom Status API allows to recover details regarding users' custom statuses. Besides having `available` and `away`, it is also possible to inform users' statuses by creating custom ones (e.g. `Vacationing`, `Lunch`).

The statuses `available` and `away` belong to a different resource, which is the user's `Appearance`. They are used in combination with `CustomStatus`. For example, a user can be at lunch and away if they don't want to be disturbed, or at lunch and available if they don't mind being contacted
