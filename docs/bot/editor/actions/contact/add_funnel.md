# Add Funnel

<img src={addFunnel} width={180} />

This action allows you to add a funnel to the contact talking to the bot.

This is useful whenever you want to add a specific funnel to the conversation for future reference.

The funnel must be created from the [Funnel Section](https://dash.callbell.eu/settings/sales_funnel) of your Callbell dashboard.
