# Send Quick Reply

The **Send Quick Reply** action is used to send a quick reply to your customers. 

A quick reply is a canned response you can create from your [Callbell dashboard](https://dash.callbell.eu/settings/templates) which can be a text, an image or a text with an image.

Using this action will allow you to avoid repeating the same messages over and over again.
