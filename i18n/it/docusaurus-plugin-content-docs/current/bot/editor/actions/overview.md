# Overview

Actions are the building blocks of your bot. They are the things your bot can do. For example, you can create an action that sends a message, or an action that waits for a reply.

## What kind of actions can I use in my bot flow?

There are 3 types of actions you can use in your bot flow:

- **Interaction** actions: these actions are used to interact with your customers. For example, you can use the "Send Message" action to send a message to your customers.
- **Contact** actions: these actions are used to manage the conversation. For example, you can close the conversation or transfer it to a human agent.
- **Logic** actions: these actions are used to add logic to your bot flow. For example, you can use **conditions** and **set variables** to guide the conversation.
