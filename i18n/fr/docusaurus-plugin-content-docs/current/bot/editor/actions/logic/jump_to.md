# Jump to

This action allows you to jump to a specific block of the bot sequence.

This is useful when you want to jump to a specific point of the bot sequence, for example, when the user is not able to answer a question or when the user enters inside a fallback block.

## How to use it

To use this action, you need to select the block you want to jump to. You can do this by clicking on the **Jump to** action and then selecting the block you want to jump to.
